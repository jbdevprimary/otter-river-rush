# DEPRECATED: semantic-release configuration

This file is no longer used. The project now uses release-please instead of semantic-release.

**Why?** semantic-release pushes directly to the main branch, which is now blocked by repository protection rules.

**New approach:** release-please creates a pull request for releases, which complies with branch protection rules.

See:
- `.release-please-config.json` - New release configuration
- `.release-please-manifest.json` - Version manifest
- `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` - Release workflow
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Documentation

This file is kept for historical reference.
